Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in land atmosphere interactions, influencing water and carbon cycles. Accurate SM predictions are essential for disaster management, efficient irrigation, and advancing scientific research. Deep learning (DL) models have gained popularity in SM prediction, many studies have overlooked the challenges posed by imbalanced sample distributions, which can hinder model performance, especially in capturing rare data. To address this, we propose a Sampling-Weighted Sensitive Learning Strategy that improves model generalization by giving more weight to rare samples. We conducted a comparative analysis of three conventional DL models—Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)—ensuring consistency by using the same random seed across experiments. Our findings reveal a significant accuracy improvement when employing the Sampling-Weighted Sensitive Learning Strategy. The BiLSTM model showed the most notable enhancements, with the coefficient of determination (R²) increasing by 3.44%, the unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) decreasing by 7.38%, and bias reducing by 11.64%. Although the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) improvement for BiLSTM was 2.73%, it did not exceed the 5.35% improvement observed in LSTM. These results highlight the effectiveness of addressing imbalanced sample distribution in enhancing DL models for SM prediction
